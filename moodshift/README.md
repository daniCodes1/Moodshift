# MOODSHIFT

### HackCamp 2022 Project

*Hello and welcome* to our application!
This application is designed for anyone as everyone experiences emotions that are entirely valid. 
We explore songs that are tailored for you, based on whether you're feeling happy, sad, angry, nervous,
and so many more! Music therapy has been proven to be a strong step towards connecting with
emotions and enhance quality of life - therefore regardless of your experiences, we have the songs for you!
Moodshift aims to use music as a creative art process to improve well-being.
